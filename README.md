# Qiskit-Cas9-PAM-recognition

## simple-test.py: 
- This simulates the PAM recognition process, where Arg1333 and Arg1335, respectively, provided by a beta-hairpin from the C-terminal domain of Cas9, interact with guanine nucleobases of dG2* and dG3* in the non-target strand via base-specific hydrogen bond.
- The simplification is the following: we construct a macromolecule that contains all atoms of guanine and one atom from arginine (the latter approaches from the top vertically)
- By solving for the energy surface, we would like to see if the binding happens
